# LinearRegression

# Auto MPG Prediction Project
This repository contains a project I worked on to predict automobile fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, or MPG) using linear regression. The dataset used provides various features of different cars such as horsepower, weight, and acceleration, and the goal is to predict their MPG.

# Introduction
I have recently started learning about data analysis, machine learning, and specifically linear regression models in self study. This project is a practical implementation of my learning so far, applying these concepts to a real-world dataset that contains information about cars.

The dataset I decided to work with is the "Auto MPG" dataset (Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg), which includes details like:

- MPG (Miles per Gallon): The target variable representing fuel efficiency.
- Cylinders: Number of cylinders in the car engine.
- Displacement: Engine displacement (in cubic inches).
- Horsepower: Engine horsepower.
- Weight: Vehicle weight (in lbs).
- Acceleration: Time taken to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (in seconds).
- Model Year: Year the car was manufactured.
- Origin: The country of origin of the car.

# Key Learnings
Since this is one of my first projects applying machine learning and data analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- Handling missing data and preparing datasets for analysis.
- Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- Building and evaluating a simple linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
- Interpreting common evaluation metrics such as MSE and RÂ².

# Visualizations
- A correlation heatmap to show how different features relate to each other.
- A distribution plot for MPG values to understand the range and frequency of fuel efficiencies in the dataset.
- A scatter plot comparing real vs predicted MPG values, showing how well the model performs.
